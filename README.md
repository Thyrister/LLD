## SOLID Principles

These principles are basically designed for writing classes and objects in OOPs programming.

**Single Responsibility**:  
  A class should have ony one responsibility.

**Open Closed**:  
 A class should be open for extension but for not modifications.

**Lisakov Principle**:  
  If a class has been derived from some parent class then the object of parent class can be assigned to the child object.

**Interface segregation**:  
  No force on any class to implement anything which is not required but have to implemented because of the deriving interface/class.

**Dependency Inversion**:  
  Instead of overriding the method of parent its better to declare a interface and let parent and child class inherit from that repsective interface.

### **Parallelism**
- **Definition**:  
  Parallelism involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. Each task runs on its own processor without interference from others.

- **Analogy**:  
  Think of multiple chefs, each preparing their own dish simultaneously in a kitchen.

- **Example**:  
  On a multi-core CPU, two threads can run on separate cores at the same time, genuinely executing in parallel.
